- 👋 Hi, I’m @WillemDijkhuizen
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Psychology, Art, Literature, and pretty much anything I hear about
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a whole bunch of things I'll need to start a BSc at the University of Amsterdam
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I can understand and contribute to in a meaningful way
- 📫 I'm not sure what people link to their profile exactly so I'll do that later
