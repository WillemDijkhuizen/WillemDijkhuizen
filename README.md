- 👋 Hi, I’m @WillemDijkhuizen
- 👀 I’m interested in trying to understand topics that make my head spin and hopefully developing something new eventually
- 🌱 I’m currently learning The Basics (I want to learn every language, I can't choose)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that benefits both of our knowledge
- 📫 I'm going to add my contact info later (when I have figured out what to do with it)
